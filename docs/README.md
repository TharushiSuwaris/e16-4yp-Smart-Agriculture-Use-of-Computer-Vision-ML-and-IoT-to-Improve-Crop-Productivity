## Abstract
Agriculture is the main source of the world's food supply. It has been the backbone of civilizations for thousands of years. During recent decades, the focus of agriculture has shifted to producing crops in more controlled and optimal environments in order to increase the quality and quantity of the yield at lower costs to fulfill the massive food requirements of a continuously growing population. Modern smart greenhouses are buildings that are equipped with the latest IoT devices, environment control and monitoring systems and automated irrigation and fertilizer systems to provide optimal growth conditions for crops. The latest trend in smart agriculture is to incorporate computer vision and machine learning (ML) capabilities to predict and optimize existing cropping systems to maximize productivity. The research focus on reduce the harm cased by different diseased by introducing disease/anomaly detection and identification so that the earlies and the necessary actions can be taken.
