# Smart Agriculture: Use of Computer Vision, ML and IoT  to Improve Crop Productivity
___

## The aim of the project

This is a part on an ongoing project in Agricultural Biotechnology Center, University of Peradeniya, which aims to explore the most effective time periods for the crops' growth by monitoring and analysing the development of the crops and location mapping with the environmental parameters to develop a smart agricultural system that is low cost and consumes low power ensuring an increase in the quality and the quantity of the yield. In this research, a computer vision-based movement control system for the camera setup and a plant disease anomaly detection system using computer vision and machine learning will be developed for further increasement of the crop yeild.
